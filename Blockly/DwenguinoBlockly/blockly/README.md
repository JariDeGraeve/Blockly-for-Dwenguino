# DwenguinoBlockly

DwenguinoBlockly is a version of Google Blockly specifically developed for the [Dwenguino](http://www.dwengo.org/tutorials/dwenguino) microcontroller board. Dwenguino is fully compatible with Arduino so this plugin can also be used to program other Arduino boards.
This version is based on [BlocklyDuino](https://github.com/BlocklyDuino/BlocklyDuino) an adaptation of Google Blockly for Arduino.
